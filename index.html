            <h3>| Why</h3>
            <h2>Why is Jean-Michel Basquiat my favourite visual artist?</h2>
            <p>
              Basquiat first achieved fame as part of the graffiti duo SAMO,
              alongside Al Diaz, writing enigmatic epigrams in the cultural
              hotbed of Manhattan's Lower East Side during the late 1970s, where
              rap, punk, and street art coalesced into early hip-hop music
              culture. By the early 1980s, his paintings were being exhibited in
              galleries and museums internationally. At 21, Basquiat became the
              youngest artist to ever take part in Documenta in Kassel, Germany.
              At 22, he was one of the youngest to exhibit at the Whitney
              Biennial in New York. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a
              retrospective of his artwork in 1992.

              <h5>About</h5>
              <p>
                “Basquiat x Warhol. Painting four hands” is the most important
                exhibition ever dedicated to this extraordinary body of work and
                brings together more than three hundred works and documents
                including eighty canvases jointly signed by the two artists.
                Between 1984 and 1985, Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) and Andy
                Warhol (1928-1987) created around 160 paintings together in
                tandem, “à quatre mains”, including some of the largest works
                produced during their respective careers.

              <h4>The Inner Island</h4>
              <h5>Where</h5>
              <p>Hyères | France</p>
              <h5>When</h5>
              <p>APR 28,2023 - NOV 04,2023</p>
              <h5>About</h5>
              <p>
                More than 80 works by fifty artists, from private and public
                collections, including the Carmignac collection, but also new
                productions, will draw the dotted outlines of an inner island,
                inviting each visitor to fill in the gaps in their own way. n
                the beginning are landscapes and bodies, landscapes in bodies
                then, as dreams often like to produce, a tangle of situation,
                situations that are blurry, pleasant, and sometimes disturbing.
                Faced with work acting as mirages, the gaze wanders.
